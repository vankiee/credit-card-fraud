# Detecting Credit Card Fraud

This repo includes a classifier that detects fraudulent credit card transactions. First, I scaled the data and did some exploratory data analysis. To distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent, 4 different Machine Learning algorithms were attempted: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network, Gradient Boosting.

The model could be useful for credit card companies.
